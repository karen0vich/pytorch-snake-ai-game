# Snake Game with Deep Q Learning

This project implements the classic Snake game using reinforcement learning with Deep Q Learning. The agent learns to play the game by making decisions based on its current state.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/karen0vich/pytorch-snake-ai-game.git 
    cd pytorch-snake-ai-game 
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the training script to train the agent:

```bash
python agent.py
